		<p>Shenzhen was a tiny fishing village in 70s. One spring in 1979, 
  	    an old man drew a circle around the south China sea. Since then,
        the city of Shenzhen has embarked on a journey of wonders.</p>

		In the early 1950s, Britain began to seal the border. Over the next 
		three decades, one of the reasons the border town of Shenzhen became 
		famous at home and abroad was that it continued to smuggle people in.
		From the 1950s until the founding of Shenzhen, nearly 300,000 people 
		from Bao 'an county were smuggled into Hong Kong.</p>
